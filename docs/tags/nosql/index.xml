Actually I moved from Copenhagen to Brisbane, Australia with my whole family, just to try living and working in a different country - and of course to give our 3 kids and ourselves a great experience/ adventure. Anyway, I got a job in the Australian consultancy &lt;a href="http://readify.net"&gt;Readify&lt;/a&gt; and one of the perks there is PD or Professional Development for up to 20 days a year. 20 days where I can work with/learn whatever I feel like (well almost. I need to justify the relevance of the topic and I have to produce something that my colleagues can benefit from too). Yeah I know pretty sweet! So the last 2 days I have had my first PD and my goal was to get familiar with &lt;a href="https://www.rethinkdb.com/"&gt;RethinkDB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
