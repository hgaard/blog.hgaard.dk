      <description>Why As a consultant, I sometimes work with clients that aren&amp;rsquo;t using the best source control software that is currently available. This sometimes means that git is not the preferred tool for source control.
Even though you can&amp;rsquo;t always control the infrastructure of your workplace, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be an excuse to stick with suboptimal tools to do your job. You are better than that!
My main gripe with TFS (or any centralized source control system that I know of) is the branching story.</description>

      <description>The last year or so at Schultz we have started to use git for more and more projects, and I have become the goto guy for git related issues. The last few times new developers have joined my project or started a new project using I have compiled an email with useful links on git and git from Visual Studio. So thought I might just put it in a blog post instead.</description>
