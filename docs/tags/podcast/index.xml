      <description>I recently went through my draft posts and found this little post about 3 podcasts, I at the time thought were quite awesome. For some reason, I never got around to publishing it, but since I still think they are quite awesome here they are:
I thought I might share a few good podcasts I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to recently.
 Yehuda Katz - Rails/Ember/Rust Jose Valim - Elixir  Matz (Yukihiro Matsumoto) - Ruby  The main reason I found these podcast interesting is that it tells the story behind some very prominent people in our industry and for 2 of them, it seems they started in programming by pure accident and turned out awesome!</description>
