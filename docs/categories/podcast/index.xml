For some reason, I never got around to publishing it, but since I still think they are quite awesome here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I might share a few good podcasts I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://changelog.com/podcast/189" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Yehuda Katz - Rails/Ember/Rust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://changelog.com/podcast/194" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Jose Valim - Elixir &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://changelog.com/podcast/202" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Matz (Yukihiro Matsumoto) - Ruby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason I found these podcast interesting is that it tells the story behind some very prominent people in our industry and for 2 of them, it seems they started in programming by pure accident and turned out awesome!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
