      <description>Why As a consultant, I sometimes work with clients that aren&amp;rsquo;t using the best source control software that is currently available. This sometimes means that git is not the preferred tool for source control.
Even though you can&amp;rsquo;t always control the infrastructure of your workplace, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be an excuse to stick with suboptimal tools to do your job. You are better than that!
My main gripe with TFS (or any centralized source control system that I know of) is the branching story.</description>
