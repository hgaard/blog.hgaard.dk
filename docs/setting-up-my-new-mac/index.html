<a href=https://blog.hgaard.com/tags/windows-8.1>Windows 8.1</a></h2></header><section id=post-body><p>I recently got a new machine. And since i do a fair bit of iOS development (through Xamarin) I chose to get a mac. However, since I still do most of my work on Windows I would like to be able to boot it directly into Windows. No problem I thought, mac has Bootcamp. I&rsquo;ll just install the newest version of Windows using the Bootcamp assistant. Well everything went well until the Windows installation had to update the boot record. I popped a message box stating that &ldquo;Could not update the boot configuration&rdquo;. No way to continue!</p><p>After quite a bit og googling and reading I found that I found a working solution <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5474320?start=585&amp;tstart=0">here</a> (on page 40!). It&rsquo;s posted by a guy called <strong>KNNSpeed</strong>. For convenience i&rsquo;ll republish the solution here:</p><blockquote><ol><li>Using an .iso of Windows 8.1 I bought from the Microsoft Online Store, I copied the .iso to my rMBP and pointed Bootcamp to it to make the USB installer. The image created is slightly over 4GB, so it&rsquo;s important to use an 8GB flashdrive. There have been reports of issues caused by using 4GB flashdrives, so 8GB or larger is the way to go.</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol start=2><li>After letting the Boot Camp Assistant do its thing (I personally use a 50/50 split, but more importantly I checked all 3 checkboxes) and entering my password to install the helper tool (if you don&rsquo;t use a password you probably won&rsquo;t see the helper tool prompt), I rebooted and went right into the EFI Boot option in the boot manager (the hold-down-ALT-at-bootup menu).</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol start=3><li>In Windows 8.1&rsquo;s setup, I got an error about installing over the BOOTCAMP partition. No problem, if we&rsquo;re installing Windows8.1 in native EFI mode, we can&rsquo;t use a single partition anyway since Windows needs to make an extra MSR partition. It can&rsquo;t do that when BOOTCAMP fills up all the empty space! Solution: delete that BOOTCAMP partition right there in Windows setup, and click &ldquo;New.&rdquo; You should be able to make an NTFS partition that will fit right into the empty space you just made, and you&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;re on the right track because there&rsquo;ll be a second partition labelled MSR that gets created, too.</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol start=4><li>Continue to install Windows as normal in the NTFS partition you just made (the non-MSR one). This is why I used the USB method; DVDs are so slow when doing Windows setup. Anyways, you should get the classic &ldquo;Could not update the boot configuration&rdquo; error at the end. DON&rsquo;T PANIC, the next step fixes that.</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol start=5><li>Click OK or Continue or whatever it says (it&rsquo;s been a while), and wait for your MacBook Pro to reboot, and go to the ALT menu. Now turn off your computer (or boot into OS X and shut it down, whatever&ndash;just turn it off without doing anything), turn it back on and do a PRAM/NVRAM reset (Hold Command+Option+P+R until you hear the chime play a second time), and go back to the ALT menu. Try not to miss the menu and boot into OS X, since I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;ll mess anything up (it might, and you&rsquo;ll have to NVRAM reset again). Go right back into EFI Boot and proceed with Windows setup as normal.</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol start=6><li>Windows should install with no errors, and when you reboot you now need to go right into the &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; drive in the ALT boot menu, as you&rsquo;re done with booting from the flashdrive. Also, it&rsquo;s OK if you go into OS X by accident now&ndash;just don&rsquo;t remove the flashdrive yet. If Windows reboots during this part of the installation, just use the ALT boot menu to go back into the Windows drive (remember: this isn&rsquo;t the &ldquo;Windows&rdquo; flashdrive icon&ndash;it&rsquo;s the Windows hard drive icon).</li></ol></blockquote><blockquote><ol start=7><li>Once Windows is done installing, it&rsquo;ll ask you to install the Bootcamp drivers. Go ahead and do that and reboot into Windows. Now go into &ldquo;This PC&rdquo; or &ldquo;Computer&rdquo; or whatever Microsoft renamed &ldquo;My Computer&rdquo; to and run &ldquo;Setup.exe&rdquo; from the flashdrive&rsquo;s WindowsSupport folder to install the Bootcamp drivers again. Apparently the setup that runs earlier misses a few things for some reason.</li></ol></blockquote></section></article><footer id=post-meta class=clearfix><a href=https://twitter.com/hgaard><img class=avatar src=https://blog.hgaard.com/images/avatar.png><div><span class=dark>Jakob Højgaard</span>
