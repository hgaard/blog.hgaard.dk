For some reason, I never got around to publishing it, but since I still think they are quite awesome here they are:
I thought I might share a few good podcasts Iâ€™ve listened to recently.
Yehuda Katz - Rails/Ember/Rust Jose Valim - Elixir Matz (Yukihiro Matsumoto) - Ruby The main reason I found these podcast interesting is that it tells the story behind some very prominent people in our industry and for 2 of them, it seems they started in programming by pure accident and turned out awesome!</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/avoid-the-microservice-fallacy/>Avoid The Microservice Fallacy</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2018-02-05 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Feb 5, 2018</time></div></div><div class=summary>Last year I had the pleasure of speaking at the DDD conference here in Brisbane. It was a really good experience and I enjoyed doing the talk a lot. One of the great things about the DDD conference is the engagement of the audience and community and thus the amount of feedback you get as a speaker. A lot of the comments I got were really positive which I obviously appreciate immensely. But I also got quite a lot of good suggestions on things to improve, like;</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/you-should-use-git-even-thoug-you-cant/>You should use git even though you can't</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2018-01-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Jan 23, 2018</time></div></div><div class=summary>Why ðŸ”—As a consultant, I sometimes work with clients that arenâ€™t using the best source control software that is currently available. This sometimes means that git is not the preferred tool for source control.
Even though you canâ€™t always control the infrastructure of your workplace, it doesnâ€™t need to be an excuse to stick with suboptimal tools to do your job. You are better than that!
My main gripe with TFS (or any centralized source control system that I know of) is the branching story. The lack of easy local branching (and later, sharing of these) really inhibits my typical workflow. The fact that a centrally-controlled server is the only possible way to create such a branch is a fundamental problem with TFS and itâ€™s tooling ecosystem, and cannot currently be solved without changing away from TFS. As a consequence, organisations that use TFS tend to treat the entire concept of a branch something that needs to be centrally controlled and managed.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/doinng-stuff-with-rethinkdb/>Doing stuff with RethinkDB</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2016-08-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Aug 4, 2016</time></div></div><div class=summary>I recently started a new job. Actually I moved from Copenhagen to Brisbane, Australia with my whole family, just to try living and working in a different country - and of course to give our 3 kids and ourselves a great experience/ adventure. Anyway, I got a job in the Australian consultancy Readify and one of the perks there is PD or Professional Development for up to 20 days a year. 20 days where I can work with/learn whatever I feel like (well almost. I need to justify the relevance of the topic and I have to produce something that my colleagues can benefit from too). Yeah I know pretty sweet! So the last 2 days I have had my first PD and my goal was to get familiar with RethinkDB.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/managing-external-users-with-azure-ad-b2c/>Managing external users with Azure AD B2C</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2016-04-21 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Apr 21, 2016</time></div></div><div class=summary>The last few weeks I have been working with a customer to implement Azure AD B2C login for their internal systems and I thought I might share my experience with you.
What is Azure AD B2C ðŸ”—First of all I might need to explain a few things, like what B2C is (assuming here that you know what Azure and AD are) and what kind of problem I am solving with it. First of all the name B2C simply means business to consumer and is in preview with another new variant of AD called B2B (Business to Business). It is intended to make it easier to set up authentication with multiple social identity providers like Facebook, Google or LinkedIn as easy as can be. But B2C also provides a way to sign up users without a social identity by providing a local account type - which in turn really is just a modified version of an AD account. For the local account B2C provides all the necessary plumbing like signup, password and user management, such that the consuming application never need to store any sensitive information. You can find a lot more information in the B2C documentation here.</div></section><section class=item><div><h1 class=title><a href=/setting-up-this-blog/>Setting up this blog</a></h1><div class=date><time datetime="2015-11-12 12:00:00 +0000 UTC">Nov 12, 2015</time></div></div><div class=summary>Introduction ðŸ”—I have had this blog brewing for a while, but have not really had the time to finish it before - I might get back to why in a later post.
Anyway here goes:
I started out hosting it on Heroku. Itâ€™s a great way of hosting web applications and you can start out on their free tier which also has a lot of free add-ons like Postgres and New Relic. How ever i like to tinker and a Pluralsight course - Mastering Your Own Domain by Rob Conery - inspired me to be more in control. For instructions on how to run Ghost on Heroku I used this guide by Greg BergÃ©.</div></section><div class=pagination><span class=next><a href=/page/2/>Older posts <span class=arrow>â†’</span></a></span></div></div></main><footer id=footer><div id=social><a class=symbol href=https://github.com/hgaard rel=me target=_blank><svg fill="#bbb" width="28" height="28" viewBox="0 0 72 72" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><title>Github</title><desc>Created with Sketch.</desc><defs/><g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g id="Social-Icons---Rounded-Black" transform="translate(-264.000000, -939.000000)"><g id="Github" transform="translate(264.000000, 939.000000)"><path d="M8 72H64c4.418278.0 8-3.581722 8-8V8c0-4.418278-3.581722-8-8-8H8c-4.418278 811624501e-24-8 3.581722-8 8V64c541083001e-24 4.418278 3.581722 8 8 8z" id="Rounded" fill="#bbb"/><path d="M35.9985 13C22.746 13 12 23.7870921 12 37.096644c0 10.6440272 6.876 19.6751861 16.4145 22.8617681C29.6145 60.1797862 30.0525 59.4358488 30.0525 58.7973276 30.0525 58.2250681 30.0315 56.7100863 30.0195 54.6996482c-6.6765 1.4562499-8.085-3.2302544-8.085-3.2302544-1.0905-2.7829884-2.664-3.5239139-2.664-3.5239139C17.091 46.4500754 19.4355 46.4801943 19.4355 46.4801943c2.4075.1701719 3.675 2.4833051 3.675 2.4833051 2.142 3.6820383 5.6175 2.6188404 6.9855 2.0014024C30.3135 49.4077535 30.9345 48.3460615 31.62 47.7436831 26.2905 47.1352808 20.688 45.0691228 20.688 35.8361671c0-2.6308879.9345-4.781379 2.4705-6.4665327C22.911 28.7597262 22.0875 26.3110578 23.3925 22.9934585c0 0 2.016-.6475568 6.6 2.4697516C31.908 24.9285993 33.96 24.6620468 36.0015 24.6515052 38.04 24.6620468 40.0935 24.9285993 42.0105 25.4632101c4.581-3.1173084 6.5925-2.4697516 6.5925-2.4697516C49.9125 26.3110578 49.089 28.7597262 48.8415 29.3696344 50.3805 31.0547881 51.309 33.2052792 51.309 35.8361671c0 9.2555448-5.6115 11.29309-10.9575 11.8894446.860999999999997.7439374 1.629 2.2137408 1.629 4.4621184C41.9805 55.4089489 41.9505 58.0067059 41.9505 58.7973276 41.9505 59.4418726 42.3825 60.1918338 43.6005 59.9554002 53.13 56.7627944 60 47.7376593 60 37.096644 60 23.7870921 49.254 13 35.9985 13" fill="#FFF"/></g></g></g></svg>
