I recently went through my draft posts and found this little post about 3 podcasts, I at the time thought were quite awesome. For some reason, I never got around to publishing it, but since I still think they are quite awesome here they are:


I thought I might share a few good podcasts I've listened to recently.

* [Yehuda Katz - Rails/Ember/Rust](https://changelog.com/podcast/189)
* [Jose Valim - Elixir ](https://changelog.com/podcast/194)
* [Matz (Yukihiro Matsumoto) - Ruby](https://changelog.com/podcast/202)

The main reason I found these podcast interesting is that it tells the story behind some very prominent people in our industry and for 2 of them, it seems they started in programming by pure accident and turned out awesome!

Enjoy!
