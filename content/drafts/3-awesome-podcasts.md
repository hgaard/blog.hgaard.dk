I thought i might share a few good podcasts I've listened to recently.

* [Yehuda Katz](https://changelog.com/podcast/189)
* [Elixir Jose Valim](https://changelog.com/podcast/194)
* [Matz (Yukihiro Matsumoto)](https://changelog.com/podcast/202)

The main reason I found these podcast interesting is that it tells the story behind some very prominent people in our industry and for 2 of them, it seems they started in programming by pure accident and turned out awesome!

Enjoy!
