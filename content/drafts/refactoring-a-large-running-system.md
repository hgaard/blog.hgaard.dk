# How to refactor a large project

**Reports from the refactoring battlefield**

*and how to put your domain back into the mighty monilith in the age of microservices*

A journey intom (regular/overengineered) enterprise design patterns and how to get back to a saner/simpler monlith.

Problems worth pondering
* overly abstract (no meaning) naming
* 


* Make sure you undertand why the refactoring is necessary
    * Many valid reasons but be 100% sure you know and understand
* Find a way to break the system into testable "components"
* A lot of tests might be temporay trancient
    * Don't keep from writing tests just because you are not sure they are long lasting
