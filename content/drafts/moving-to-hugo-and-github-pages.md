# Moving to Hugo and Github pages

## Why

- Less maintainance
- Never really liked the editing experience - prefered editing in a real editor and pusign to git repo

## How

- Hugo getting started and theme
    - Cactus bacasuse of simplicity and I'm scandinavian
    - permalink to match existing url's
    
    ```
[permalinks]
  post = "/:slug/"
  blog = "/:slug/"
  ```

    - editing in existing posts to because of different interpretation of md i.ie `####`
    - Images
- host on github pages
    - docs folder - easiest
    - publish dir
    - cname
    - dns
- alias
    - to maintain old urls and make discus work
- discus
  - [Redirect crawler](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/286778-migration-tools]
- cloudflare
    - cache all (make sure to purge when publishing)
